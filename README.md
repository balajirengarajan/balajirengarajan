I could describe myself in 3 words
<li>Self-Motivated</li>
<li>Decisive</li>
<li>Strategically focused</li> 

<br />
<I>Stability</I> is be the key on my solutions. I prefer to find the solution rather fixing the issue for the time. My passion about technology is : You could bring the expected result in multiple ways, but finding the right way is what I crazy about.
